Instructions for Plane Fury

The Game

	The aim of the game is to destroy as many enemy planes as
	you can. Enemy planes shoot out laser beams which will
	damage your plane so don’t touch them. Otherwise your plane
	will crash and it will be game over.

The Controls

	Either use the mouse to directly guide your plane or use the
	WASD key controls to move the plane in their corresponding
	direction.
		W – Move up
		A – Move left
		S – Move down
		D – Move right
		P - Pauses/Resumes the game		

The HUD

	The number in the bottom-left of the screen is the score.
	Every time you kill an enemy plane, you gain three points.
	If you simply just dodge the plane you will get one point.
	Consistently dodging planes is for idiots and it is a waste
	of time. In the bottom-right of the screen is how much
	health your plane has. When it is green, there is little or
	no damage on your plane. This is an indicator for how well
	you are doing in the game.

The Enemy Planes

	The Yellow Planes – The Sprayers

		These planes shoots out two streams of lasers which
		make them difficult to take down without taking any
		damage as they have their weak spots covered. However,
		the lasers they fire are weak and do not do much harm.

	The Orange Planes – The Smashers

		The smashers fire fairly powerful lasers. Unlike the
		sprayers, there is only one stream of lasers. What
		makes them hard is that it is tough to move pass the
		line of bullets.

	The Red Planes – The Strikers

		These planes do the most damage, three lasers and your
		plane is down. It is strongly recommended that you
		avoid the red lasers even if there are other planes.
		The downside with these planes they shoot very
		infrequently meaning the lasers aren’t too painful to
		dodge.

The Power Ups

	Health

		This power up looks like a plus and heals completely
		your plane.

	Speed

		This power up is represented by a arrow pointing to
		the rightand it increases how fast your lasers can
		move.

	Damage

		This power up can be seen by a lightening icon. It
		doubles the amount of damage each laser your plane
		can do.
